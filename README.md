## Abstract Factory üèó

### Description

The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.[1] In normal usage, the client software creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interface of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the theme. The client does not know (or care) which concrete objects it gets from each of these internal factories, since it uses only the generic interfaces of their products.[1] This pattern separates the details of implementation of a set of objects from their general usage and relies on object composition, as object creation is implemented in methods exposed in the factory interface
### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

### Structure

1. **Abstract Products:** declare interfaces for a set of distinct but related products which make up a product family.

2. **Concrete Products:** are various implementations of abstract products, grouped by variants. Each abstract product (chair/sofa) must be implemented in all given variants (Victorian/Modern).

3. **The Abstract Factory** interface declares a set of methods for creating each of the abstract products.

4. **Concrete Factories** implement creation methods of the abstract factory. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant of products and creates only those product variants.

5. Although concrete factories instantiate concrete products, signatures of their creation methods must return corresponding abstract products. This way the client code that uses a factory doesn‚Äôt get coupled to the specific variant of the product it gets from a factory. The **Client** can work with any concrete factory/product variant, as long as it communicates with their objects via abstract interfaces.
